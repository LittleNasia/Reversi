Beginings of a Reversi game engine, with planned neural network support 

not really serious, just a for fun thingie


currently it's not even an engine, but move generation works ! wow

update!!!
now search with many improvements works as well!! 
it could be an engine now if you want it to, but it does not follow any protocol and it's pretty bad lol
eval is whatever random thing I put fast with one goal in mind, and that is being volatile, but also kinda othello related lol
